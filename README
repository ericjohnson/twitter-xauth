twitter-xauth
-------------

This is an extremely simple twitter client for Mac OS X and iOS, which
uses xauth for authentication. The only other feature provided are
status updates. I created this project because I wanted something
small and simple, and need only to be able to do status updates on
twitter. I'm posting it in hopes that it might be of use to someone
else.

See twitter-xauth.m for example usage. Fill in values for
CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, TWITTER_USERNAME, and
TWITTER_PASSWORD. Compiles on Mac OS X using gnu make.

This code is possible thanks to documentation and code examples found
on the following websites:

Special thanks to Matt Gallagher of cocoawithlove.com for providing an
Objective-C implementation of Base64 encoding for Mac and iPhone.
